STUDIO SKYE
Modular Cliff Building Pack


Please see sample scenes for example of use.

In the pack:

6 x cliff faces (plus one mirrorred version to give variety/ balance)
Sample Scenes
Terrain Textures


++ Method ++
Place and position the prefab models using scaling and rotation to allow variety of cliff and avoid repetition. 

++ Terrain Textures ++
Rock detail textures are included to allow you to blend rock and terrain naturally - use these sparingly where cliff meets terrain. 
Some simple generic terrain textures are also included.

++ Shader ++
Unity Standard Shader has been used to give you maximum flexibility. 
Detail textures are used for Secondary Maps in the Standard Shader. 
Extra detail textures are provided  - try modifying the cliff materials by adding an alternative detail texture to the Secondary Map. This will give you more range of rock colour and feel.

++ Model Edges ++
The FBX models have low-poly style hard edges built in. You can tweak this in the Inspector. Select an FBX and go to Normals & Tangents -> Choose "Calculate" from the Normals drop down then use the Smoothing Angle slider to tweak

That's about it!

Enjoy!
